        <p>I am a designer, maker and thinker, passionate about learning and creating. I hold a 1st class BA (Hons) Sustainable Product Design from Falmouth University. This really channelled the way I approach design; taught me the importance of understanding who and what you are designing for, in addition to a critical approach to my practice. 
        Currently, I am studying MA Design Products at the Royal College of Art.</p>
