        <p>Iâ€™m a designer who is currently studying Sustainable Product Design at Falmouth University. I'm an enthusiastic student who is always looking for new project opportunities within and out of university.
        </p>

        <p>I have have always been interested in a sustainable lifestyle, my current course allows me to realise the importance of considering sustainable theories and practices when designing products. As a designer I enjoy working in both 2D and 3D and feel my previous work experience has taught me some key technical skills that has benefited me as a designer.</p>
